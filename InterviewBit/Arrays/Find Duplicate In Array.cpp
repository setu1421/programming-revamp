// Observation for https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUm2ABqAs1w:

/*
(m+k) = integer*l -> this means, if you have p at the kth node and q at the start, by the time q travels m+k nodes from the start, p will finish one or more complete revolution on that loop. 

i.e., p and q will coincide at the kth node again. 

But if q only travels m nodes, p  has travelled only (integer*l)- k nodes as well. So if p started at the kth node, and q at the start, they will meet at the start of the loop.
*/

// Another Approach: Using bucketing
/*
Split the numbers from 1 to n in sqrt(n) ranges so that range i corresponds to [sqrt(n) * i .. sqrt(n) * (i + 1)).

Do one pass through the stream of numbers and figure out how many numbers fall in each of the ranges.

At least one of the ranges will contain more than sqrt(n) elements.

Do another pass and process just those elements in the oversubscribed range.

Using a hash table to keep frequencies, youâ€™ll find a repeated element.

This is O(sqrt(n)) memory and 2 sequential passes through the stream.
